# Bracket Matcher package

Highlight, jump between, and complete brackets in Atom.

Currently supports `[]`, `()`, and `{}`.

Use `ctrl-m` to jump to the bracket matching the one adjacent to the cursor;
if there's no adjacent bracket, jumps to the nearest enclosing bracket.

Matching brackets and quotes are sensibly inserted for you. If you dislike this
functionality, you can disable it via the settings menu.
